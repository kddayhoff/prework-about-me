    <h2>What is Their History?</h2>
    <p>Alkaline Trio a Chicago based punk band. They have been influence by bands such as Social Distortion, Ramones, Misfits, Green Day, The Clash, Joy Division, and NOFX, just to name a few. They have been around since 1996, the original band formed by Matt Skiba, who is still their guitarist to this day. Their popularity has increased exponentially over time. Their album <i>From Here to Infirmary</i> rose above the <i>Billboard</i> Top 200 mark. They formed their own record label in 2009, Heart and Skull. Their 2013 album <i>My Shame is True</i>, topped the charts at #24.</p>

    <h2>Where Are They Now?</h2>
    <p>Alkaline Trio continues to rock to this day and show no signs of slowing down. Matt Skiba has ventured out to several side projects. The most notable is Blink-182. He joined the band in 2015, replacing the popular Tom DeLonge. He still currently records and tours with Blink-182, their latest album <i>Nine</i> having dropped in 2019. It displays Matt's clear influence on the band, producing a heavier punk sound, leaving their pop-punk days behind.</p>
